Where we can also have to enter all the quantities of items ordered and received.We also have that provision to upload images of received product regarding damages etc,.

Note: If there is no any purchase order created, User has to enter all the items that are received. 

After sucessfull submission of all the information in the above screen, that received items will taken in to the stock with a new batch number assigned for that particular branch where we received the stock. That batch number will be having such information like date, etc,.
